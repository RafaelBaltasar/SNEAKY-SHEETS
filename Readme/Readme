When we find the bug of the code I noticed that in our Database theres no "paid" in order status so we fix it and added "paid" again in the order details. One thing I did is when we finding the bug in the checkout.php we didn't find the bug there is no bug in the file so I said to my members that I think the bug is not in the checkout.php I think the bug is in the other file its just it send it to the checkout.php to make it look like the bug is in the checkout.php.
